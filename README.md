Hi.I'm Anisa.
I've written this code as a helpful gadget for students in grade 9th.I was thinking 
about new ways for teaching math which can be fun and useful for students.so I just tried to program an app which has enjoyable animations and 
explains definitions and points of mathematic in an easy way.
the language of this app is Persian and now it just includes one chapter of the 9th grade math book
wich is about sets(collections{}).
However ,I would try to make more apps that can provide impressive and lovely experience of learning and studying math.
I've been focusing on the front_end of this app so it doesn't have a great back_end.
this code's been publishing in flutter and dart.thank you for your attention:)
